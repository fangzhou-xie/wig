The remainder of this paper will be organized as follows.
\cref{sec:review} briefly reviews the Monge-Kantorivich problem, its entropic regularized Sinkhorn problem and solution.
\cref{sec:sinkhorn-algorithm} introduces the Sinkhorn algorithm and its variants to solve the entropic regularized problem.
\cref{sec:sinkhorn-gradient} derives the gradients and Jacobians of the family of Sinkhorn algorithms.
\cref{sec:wasserstein-barycenter-and-dictionary-learning} discusses the Wasserstein Barycenter and Wasserstein Dictionary Learning
problem.
\cref{sec:wdl-gradient} shows the gradient of Wasserstein Barycenter algorithm and the parameter optimization for Wasserstein Dictionary Learning.
\cref{sec:wig-model} finally presents the Wasserstein Index Generation model for automatically time-series index generation,
based on Wasserstein Dictionary Learning.
